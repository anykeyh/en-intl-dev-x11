# US International for Developer in X11

## Why

I just drop my Macbook to work on Manjaro Linux. So far I'm super happy with my setup. Except for the keyboard.

As french, we need to put accents and modifier on some letters, which leads me to use US/International layout. Without dead-keys it sucks. With dead-keys, it sucks less, until you start working on development projects.

For example, `\`` (backtick) needs you to type backtick + space to print out. Same occurs with `'` quotes or `"` double-quote, etc etc...

This project is made to fix that, step by step
